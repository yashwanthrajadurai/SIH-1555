## Project: Railway Station Smart Navigation System (RSNS)
# Problem Statement
Smart India Hackathon 2025 - SIH 1710
Title: Enhancing Navigation for Railway Station Facilities and Locations

Passengers often face difficulties navigating large and unfamiliar railway stations. Our goal is to design a multi-platform navigation system that provides real-time, accurate, and accessible directions inside railway stations.

# Proposed Solution
We propose RSNS (Railway Station Smart Navigation System) which consists of:

1. Mobile Application (Android & iOS)
3D interactive maps of the station.

Step-by-step walking navigation.

Real-time facility updates.

Voice-assisted navigation (for visually impaired passengers).

Accessibility options (wheelchair-friendly paths, elevators).

2. Digital Kiosks at Stations
Touch-screen kiosks at multiple entry points.

Search any location or facility easily.

Generate QR code for navigation path to continue on mobile.

3. Admin Panel (Web)
For railway officials to update:

# Map layouts

Facility locations

Temporary changes (construction, closed paths, etc.)

4. Integration with Existing Indian Railway Apps
Connect with apps like IRCTC Rail Connect or station Wi-Fi apps.

Provide station navigation options before passenger arrives.

# Architecture Overview
User (Mobile/Kiosk) -> API Gateway -> Backend Server -> Database
                               ↳ Map Rendering Service (3D)
                               ↳ Voice Assistant Service
Admin Panel -> Backend -> Database

# How it Works
Passenger enters station.

Uses kiosk or mobile app to select their destination (e.g., "Platform 5", "Restroom", "Food Court").

App generates step-by-step walking path.

Voice assistant can guide them if needed.

If facilities are moved (construction etc.), real-time update is pushed to user devices.

Admin dashboard allows station authorities to modify the station map dynamically.

# Future Enhancements
AR Navigation inside station (Augmented Reality walking guide).

Multilingual voice assistants (Hindi, Tamil, etc.).

AI-based crowd density monitoring to suggest less crowded routes.

Integration with station parking and EV charging stations.

# Sample UI Screens (can be added later)
Home Screen – "Find a Facility" / "Get Directions"

Map Screen – 3D Station Layout

Voice Guide Screen – Accessible Mode

Admin Panel – Update Facility Locations

Kiosk Interface – Touch-to-search Navigation

# Conclusion
This solution directly addresses the pain points of millions of Indian railway passengers by providing:

Better navigation inside massive stations,

Inclusive design for disabled passengers,

Real-time dynamic updates,

and integration with existing railway apps — making travel easier, faster, and smarter.
